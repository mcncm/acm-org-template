# ACM org-mode template

This is an adaptation of the ACM conference [LaTeX template](http://www.sigplan.org/sites/default/files/acmart/current/acmart-pacmpl-template.tex) to org mode, indented for export to LaTeX.

Most of the document consists of `LATEX_HEADER` settings in a drawer, and do not show up in GitHub's `.org` preview. To see the contents of the document, don't forget to hit the "raw" button.

I found [this blog post](https://rgoswami.me/posts/org-arb-tex/) particularly helpful in constructing it.
